# Design-Developed-Gym-Website


Using XAMPP and PHP for backend, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend, I created a gym website. It has a simple design and an easy signup process, allowing only registered users to access the site. With this platform, users can sign up easily and explore various fitness resources. Security measures are in place to protect user information. Overall, it offers a straightforward solution for fitness enthusiasts.
